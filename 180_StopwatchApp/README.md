# SwiftUI Stopwatch App

180 - We use a custom button style to imitate the appearance of the stopwatch buttons on iOS - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E180-custom-button-styles)  
181 - We enable our stopwatch buttons to self-size to fit their labels - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E181-self-sizing-buttons)  
182 - We add the data model for the stopwatch to make it functional - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E182-adding-the-data-model)  
183 - We add lap times to the model, show them in a list, and highlight the shortest and longest laps - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E183-lap-times)  
192 - We draw an analog clock face and add moving pointers - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E192-analog-clock)  
193 - We add labels to the analog clock face, and we make it configurable to reuse it for counting the minutes - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E193-analog-clock-part-2)  
194 - We create a view that automatically scales a text view to fill the available space - [Video](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E194-scaling-text-to-fit)
